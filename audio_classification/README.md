This project focuses on audio classification for tracking animal diversity and population. It compares four machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC), and Logistic Regression, to classify audio data from the freefield1010 dataset which can be accessed from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghaw/freefield1010. While the results showed similar accuracy scores for all algorithms, SGDC performed relatively better. However, the accuracy scores were not as high as expected, suggesting the need to explore alternative algorithms for improved classification.
