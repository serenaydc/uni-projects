This project involves two distinct tasks. 

In Part A, the objective is to perform a regression analysis to predict a kangaroo's weight based on its tail length. The dataset comprises two continuous variables, weight in grams and tail length in millimeters. Part A includes Exploratory Data Analysis tasks, such as loading the dataset and creating a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between tail length and weight. It is followed by Regression Tasks, which require splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets, fitting linear regression and polynomial regression models, as well as KNN regression models. The best-performing model is selected and visualized alongside the data.

In Part B, the focus shifts to regression tasks for predicting acute aquatic toxicity. The dataset is derived from the QSAR fish toxicity dataset and contains six features related to molecular descriptors of chemicals used to predict toxicity. The target variable is L50. The project begins with Exploratory Data Analysis tasks that involve visualizing the target variable's distribution, exploring feature-target relationships via scatterplots, and computing the correlation matrix. The Regression Tasks encompass splitting the dataset, fitting linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression models with different alpha values, and creating a pandas dataframe to store results, including R-squared scores.
