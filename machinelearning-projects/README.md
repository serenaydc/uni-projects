## Project 1
Project 1 involves two distinct tasks. In Part A, the objective is to perform a regression analysis to predict a kangaroo's weight based on its tail length. The dataset comprises two continuous variables, weight in grams and tail length in millimeters. Part A includes Exploratory Data Analysis tasks, such as loading the dataset and creating a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between tail length and weight. It is followed by Regression Tasks, which require splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets, fitting linear regression and polynomial regression models, as well as KNN regression models. The best-performing model is selected and visualized alongside the data.

In Part B, the focus shifts to regression tasks for predicting acute aquatic toxicity. The dataset is derived from the QSAR fish toxicity dataset and contains six features related to molecular descriptors of chemicals used to predict toxicity. The target variable is L50. The project begins with Exploratory Data Analysis tasks that involve visualizing the target variable's distribution, exploring feature-target relationships via scatterplots, and computing the correlation matrix. The Regression Tasks encompass splitting the dataset, fitting linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression models with different alpha values, and creating a pandas dataframe to store results, including R-squared scores.

# Project 2
Project 2 comprises two different sets of tasks. In the first part, Classification with Numerical Data, the project involves loading and preprocessing train and test datasets. The target variable is "label," and feature histograms are visualized. A Logistic Regression classifier is trained using GridSearchCV, and then two other low-level classifiers are chosen and evaluated with grid search and cross-validation. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers are also employed, and feature importance is visualized.

The second part, Classification with Text Data, involves loading and processing text data from "cover train.csv" and "cover test.csv." The content from "title" and "description" columns is combined and transformed into a Bag-of-Words representation with TF-IDF scaling. A classifier is trained, and its performance is evaluated on the train and test sets.

In the final part, Classification with Image Data, image data from "cover train.npz" and "cover test.npz" is loaded and labeled. PCA is applied to the dataset, followed by training a classifier, and evaluating its performance on the train and test sets.
